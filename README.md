If you want to run this app:

##Environmental variables setup

1. Create a file named `.env` in the same level as `.gitignore`
2. Make sure `.env` file name is in `.gitignore`
3. In a React application's `.env` file, you can declare an environment variable by putting `REACT_APP_(VARIABLE_NAME_HERE)` and assign it to, for example, your API key(to hide it).
4. To use the variable elsewhere in a `.js` file, use `process.env.REACT_APP_(VARIABLE_NAME_HERE)`.
